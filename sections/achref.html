            When Kit founder Nathan Barry published his first book in 2013, he
            discovered what every creator learns:<strong>
              email marketing works</strong
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem? It was impossibly complicated. He wanted to create a
            platform that was accessible for creators running solo businesses,
            with tools they could easily use to share their expertise and serve
            people well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today Kit is still bootstrapped, mission-driven, and seriously
            focused on solving the real problems creators face, so you can get
            back to creating the work that matters.
