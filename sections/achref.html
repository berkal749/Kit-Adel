<p>When Kit founder Nathan Barry published his first book in 2013, he discovered what every creator learns:<strong> email marketing works</strong>.</p>
<p>The problem? It was impossibly complicated. He wanted to create a platform that was accessible for creators running solo businesses, with tools they could easily use to share their expertise and serve people well.</p>
<p>Today Kit is still bootstrapped, mission-driven, and seriously focused on solving the real problems creators face, so you can get back to creating the work that matters.</p>
